# Summary

Neuroimaging tools such as fMRI allow for non-invasive examination of brain activity. Analysis of the rich data produced by these imaging modalities can prove challenging, 
and methods that allow for dimensionality reduction can reduce its associated computational demands. Here we provide a Python package that can subdivide the surface 
of the brain into equally sized regions of interest. Blah blah blah...
